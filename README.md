# TheWendigoCottage
The Wendigo Cottage is a choose your own story game written in Python, created by me in my free-time outside university that you can play for free.
The game is for now still prettty barren but I have plans to continue expanding the amount of chapters and content in the future. The game requires you to be able to run python for now, might attempt a package in the future.
The Wendigo Cottage is under GNU AGPLv3 for all intents and purposes.
